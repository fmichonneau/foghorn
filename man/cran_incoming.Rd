    "archive", "waiting")
)
}
\arguments{

\item{folders}{Which folders of the CRAN FTP site do you want to inspect? Default:

}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with the following columns:

}
}
\description{
Check where your package stands in the CRAN incoming queue.
}
\details{
When submitting a package to CRAN, it undergoes a series of checks before it
is published and publicly available. \code{cran_incoming()} allows you to check
the packages that are currently in the queue, and the folder where they are
located. This information could help you track your package submission. Only
the following folders are considered (approximately in order of the CRAN
queue sequence): \code{newbies}, \code{inspect}, \code{pretest}, \code{recheck}, \code{pending},
\code{waiting}, \code{publish}, \code{archive}. The folders named after the initials of the
CRAN volunteers are not inspected.
}
\note{
The meaning of the package folders is as follows
(see Hornik, Ligges and Zeileis \url{https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf} and Uwe Ligges mailing list comment \url{https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2019q1/003631.html}):
\describe{
\item{newbies}{for first time submission; package will be manually inspected.}
\item{inspect}{package is awaiting manual inspection; always happens for first time submissions and for packages with problems that are likely to be false positives}
\item{pretest}{a human has triggered a new auto-check of the package}
\item{recheck}{package has passed checks and is waiting for reverse dependency checking}
\item{pending}{a CRAN team member has to do a closer inspection and needs more time}
\item{waiting}{CRAN's decision is waiting for a response from the package maintainer, e.g. when issues are present that CRAN cannot check for in the incoming checks}
\item{publish}{package is awaiting publication}
\item{archive}{package rejected: it does not pass the checks cleanly and the problems are unlikely to be false positives}
}
}

The information provided here is only to give you an indication of where
